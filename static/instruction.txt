Flask Project Setup Instructions (New Device)

1. **Install MySQL:**
   - Download and install **XAMPP** (which includes MySQL) or install **MySQL** independently.
   - If using XAMPP:
     - Install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.
     - Open XAMPP and start the **MySQL** server.

2. **Create Database and Tables:**
   - Database name is "mp"
   - Open **phpMyAdmin** in a browser (usually accessible via http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
   - Create a **new database** with the same name as your original project database, or choose a new name.
   - Create tables by either:
     - Manually running `CREATE TABLE` SQL queries.
     - Importing an existing `.sql` file via the **Import** tab in phpMyAdmin.
   - Table also be created automatically by main code 
	with app.app_context():
        	db.create_all()

3. **Set Up the Python Environment:**
   - **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your new device. (Use the same version as the original device if possible.)
   - **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
     - Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to your project folder.
     - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       python -m venv venv
       ```
     - Activate the virtual environment:
       - On Windows:
         ```bash
         .
env\Scripts ctivate
         ```
       - On macOS/Linux:
         ```bash
         source venv/bin/activate
         ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Copy the `requirements.txt` file from the original device to the new device.
   - In the terminal (with the virtual environment activated), install the necessary dependencies:

	to create requirementS.txt
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

     ```bash

     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Configure Flask App for the New Database:**
   - Open the project folder and navigate to the configuration file (usually `app.py` or a separate config file).
   - Update the database connection string to match the new database:
     - Example using SQLAlchemy:
       ```python
       SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://username:password@localhost/db_name'
       ```
     - Replace **username** with your MySQL username (default is `root` if unchanged).
     - Replace **password** with your MySQL password.
     - Replace **db_name** with the name of the newly created database.

6. **Run the Flask Application:**
   - In the terminal (with the virtual environment activated), navigate to the project folder.
   - Run the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

7. **Test the Application:**
   - Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` (or the correct port).
   - Verify that the application is working as expected and that data is correctly stored in the new MySQL database.
